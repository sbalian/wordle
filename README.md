# What should you start with in [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)?

Good guesses are "sores", "sales" and "soles" according to the minimum average
[Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) for
5-character words.

See `wordle_best_first_guess.ipynb` for details of the computation.
